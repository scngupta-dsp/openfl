# Python version support policy

OpenFL extends the Python scientific community's [SPEC-0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/) recommendation of 36 months of support for Python versions, by 6 more months. This is in-line with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html), for which NEP-29 has been very successful.

This translates to the following support policy:
* **Python3.10** was released in October 2021, and will be supported by OpenFL at least until April 2025.
* **Python3.11** was released in October 2022, and will be supported by OpenFL at least until April 2026.
* **Python3.12** was released in October 2023, and will be supported by OpenFL at least until April 2027.
